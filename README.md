# types-classes-of-game
Create a generic class representing a hero in an adventure game, including properties like name, age, and type (e.g., warrior, mage, monk, ninja). The class should have an attack method that displays a message based on the hero type, specifying the type of attack used (e.g., magic for mages, sword for warriors).
